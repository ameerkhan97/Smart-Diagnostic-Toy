# Smart-Diagnostic-Toy
The Smart Toy is an interactive toy cube integrated with a sensor that has the ability to observe a childâ€™s psychological as well as physiological development by monitoring receptive communication skills, expressive communication skills, and fine motor skills.

* Worked in a team of five to build a smart toy that can monitor developmental delays of young children
* Developed an algorithm in C to generate the game that runs on a chipkit uno32 in order to monitor color and shape
recognition
* Developed a python script to plot and analyze data from a csv file sent over bluetooth in order to generate a
diagnostic report
