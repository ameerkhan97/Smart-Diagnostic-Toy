# Smart-Diagnostic-Toy
The Smart Toy is an interactive toy cube integrated with a sensor that has the ability to observe a childâ€™s psychological as well as physiological development by monitoring receptive communication skills, expressive communication skills, and fine motor skills.

* Researched, designed, documented and built a prototype smart toy as part of a team of student engineers in order to monitor developmental delays of young children 
* Developed a python script using python libraries Pandas, Matplotlib, NumPy, SciPy to analyze, interpret and visually represent the test data from a csv file in a diagnostic report
